/*********************************************************
    Exercise 4
		Write a function called removeEntry() to remove an entry 
from a linked list. The sole argument to the procedure should be a 
pointer to the list. Have the function remove the entry after the one 
pointed to by the argument. (Why canâ€™t you remove the entry pointed to 
by the argument?) You need to use the special structure you set up in 
exercise 3 to handle the special case of removing the first element from 
the list.
*********************************************************/

/* The entry passed as argument can't be removed because you need to 
provide the precedent entry, which contains the pointer to the 
structure.*/

    int value;
    struct entry* next;
};

void removeEntry (struct entry* remEntry)
{  
    remEntry->next = remEntry->next->next;   // &begin -> next = &n1  EQUIVALENT TO begin = (struct entry) {0, &n1}   if &begin is passed in removeEntry from main
}

int main (void)
{
    struct entry begin, n0, n1, n2;
    struct entry* pointer;

    begin = (struct entry) {0, &n0};                 // &begin
    n0 = (struct entry) {1, &n1};                   // & n0
    n1 = (struct entry) {2, &n2};                  // & n1
    n2 = (struct entry) {3, (struct entry*) 0};   // & n2

    pointer = begin.next;

    printf("Before the removal: \n");
    while (pointer)
    {
        printf("Value in linked list entry: %i.\n", pointer->value);
        pointer = pointer->next;
    }

    pointer = begin.next;
